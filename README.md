# **Overview**
This repository contains a Business Analysis Case Study focused on optimizing sales tracking and lead management for V-Cosmetics, a growing beauty care brand. The study explores pain points, business requirements, process workflows, and system design to propose an efficient, structured solution for improving sales operations.

# **Problem Statement**
V-Cosmetics' sales managers struggle to efficiently assign, monitor, and track store visits, while sales representatives lack a centralized system to log activities and manage leads. These challenges result in:

ðŸš© Inefficiencies in sales tracking & reporting

ðŸš© Limited visibility into store visits & follow-ups

ðŸš© Missed opportunities due to lack of real-time updates

To address these gaps, a structured Lead Management System (LMS) has been designed to enhance tracking, improve automation, and provide actionable insights into the sales pipeline.

# **Proposed Solution**
A streamlined Lead Management System (LMS) designed to:

âœ… Enable sales managers to efficiently assign and monitor store visits.

âœ… Empower sales reps with a centralized system to log activities & track progress.

âœ… Provide the organization with structured sales data for better decision-making.

This repository provides a detailed breakdown of the solution, including business requirements, user stories, and system workflows to illustrate the end-to-end process.

# **Key Artifacts**
This repository contains essential BA artifacts used in the case study:

âœ… **Business Analysis Case Study Document** â€“ Captures business requirements, user stories, and solution design.

âœ… **Use Case Diagram** â€“ Visual representation of system interactions and system behaviour.

âœ… **Wireframes** - Low-fidelity UI wireframes for designing the proposed solution.

# **Overview**
This repository contains a **Business Analysis Case Study** focused on optimizing **lead management and sales tracking** for **V-Cosmetics**, a growing beauty care brand. The study explores **both inbound and outbound lead management**, pain points, business requirements, process workflows, and system design to propose an efficient, structured solution for improving sales operations.

# **Problem Statement**
V-Cosmetics' sales managers struggle to efficiently assign, monitor, and track **both inbound and outbound leads**, while sales representatives lack a centralized system to log activities and manage follow-ups. These challenges result in:

ðŸš© Inefficiencies in lead tracking & reporting

ðŸš© Limited visibility into sales activities, store visits, and follow-ups

ðŸš© Missed sales opportunities due to lack of real-time updates

To address these gaps, a structured **Lead Management System (LMS)** has been designed to enhance lead tracking, automate processes, and provide **actionable insights** into the sales pipeline.

# **Proposed Solution**
A **streamlined Lead Management System (LMS)** designed to:

âœ… Enable sales managers to efficiently **assign and monitor inbound and outbound leads**

âœ… Empower sales reps with a **centralized system** to log activities, track follow-ups, and manage store visits

âœ… Provide structured sales data for **data-driven decision-making and performance tracking**

This repository provides a **detailed breakdown** of the solution, including **business requirements, user stories, and system workflows** to illustrate the end-to-end process.

# **Key Artifacts**
This repository contains essential **Business Analysis (BA) artifacts** used in the case study:

âœ… **Business Analysis Case Study Document** â€“ Captures **gap analysis, business requirements, user stories with acceptance criteria, priority & effort estimation, and solution design (wireframes)**.
